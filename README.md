# Portfolio_v1
First iteration of my portfolio, I started it many years ago and paused it for years, so I have to standardize the nomenclature and clean it up.

It has a particular navigation feature, basically it is to move all the content of the page and in different directions, the background does not move on purpose to give the feeling of better navigation.
The base is simple although it can still be improved a lot.
Later, someday, I will improve the site with more advanced javascript functionalities.

It is not possible to access the code or requests to the 3rd party API I am using because it is hosted on Firestore. This is because I want to avoid sharing my access token because of the possibility of someone misusing it.
